{#
  In the case of GHO, the homepage is a node with the site title so we
  don't need to have a `h1` there. Other non-node pages use the `page-title`
  block which uses a `h1` tag as well. So that should be fairly consistent.

  There is one logo per language on the site, so our theme adds current language
  to this block and we pick an SVG with that variable included.

<a href="{{ path('<front>') }}" title="{{ 'Home'|t }}" rel="home" class="cd-site-logo">
  <img src="{{ site_logo }}{{ language|upper }}.svg" alt="{{ site_name }}" aria-label="{{ 'Home'|t }}"/>
</a>
